# MateZ iOS Client 🎮📱

MateZ is an iOS client for the MateZ platform — a lightweight social network built to help gamers connect, discover new players, and join lobbies that match their interests.

This app is developed in **SwiftUI**, uses **Swift 5 native concurrency**, and communicates through a **custom Web API**.
To use the client, you will need the MateZ Server, available in a separate repository.
