# MateZ
This is a SwiftUI iOS client for the MateZ Server, developed as a companion to showcase the MateZ project.

MateZ is a delightful project for all gamers out there. It is a social tool, to help gamers connect and discover new friends to play together with. 
It accomplishes this by using a custom developed Client-Server API providing the following features:
- Username and password authentication
- Creation of a unique gamer profile
- Possibility to pin all the favourite games to the user profile
- Great on-boarding that guides the user through the initial setup phase
- Support for local authentication with FaceID and TouchID
- Creation of customized lobbies

# How to use
After your account has been created, finding a game with MateZ will be very easy: the application will display all the lobbies that match with your preferences. It is possible to filter the search results with even more parameters. Once you find a game that suits you, check out the other gamer's username (PlayStation or Steam ecc..) and add them to your friends. If you want you can also hop in the global chat, which is still a work-in-progress *(or was i should say)*

This application includes externally acquired assets such as game icons. All credits go to their respective owners, these assets AT ANY POINT have NOT been used for commercial purposes (this is a learning project). Big fat thanks to my team mates Giada Pisani and Laura Bognanni for their awesome UI, UX and custom assets work. Thanks to Aryan Garg for his chat screen contribution.
